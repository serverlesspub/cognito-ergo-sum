# Cognito Ergo Sum

Minimal [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) authentication Secure
Remote Password (SRP) implementation, replacing the outdated
[amazon-cognito-identity-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-cognito-identity-js) library,
with the goal of only depending on AWS JS Client SDK, and providing a minimal,
focused library for web sites that want to integrate Cognito authentication.

Extracted from and inspired by [AWS Amplify JS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js), 
but without all the other stuff that Amplify brings along.

Developed by AWS Heroes [Slobodan StojanoviÄ‡](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/slobodan-stojanovic/) and [Gojko Adzic](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/gojko-adzic/). 

Status: Work in progress
