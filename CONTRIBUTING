# Running tests

## Creating the test stack for integration tests

To create the test cfn stack, run:

```
make up
``` 

You can optionally specify a different test stack name and AWS region

```
make up AWS_REGION=us-west-1 STACK_NAME=MyTestStack
```

To create the .env file required by tests, run:

```
make .env
```

## Run JEST

On Node 22 and later, you can just run

```
npm t
```

For earlier versions, you may need to load modules:

```
NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-vm-modules" npm t
```
